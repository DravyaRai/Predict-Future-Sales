# Predict-Future-Sales
Here we are provided with daily historical sales data. Our task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations is part of the challenge.

I have built sales prediction models using sci-kit learn and statsmodels libraries to predict sales price of store sales data.

I have mentioned various regression metrics to measure performance of regression models with their applications.
